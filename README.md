# Fetching Static + Dynamic Data with Gatsby

Gatsby is great because it allows you to build a static website using best-of-breed paradigms in React, using the flexible syntax of GraphQL and outputting static files that implement best practices for the modern web.

But static sites have a problem with dynamic data, data that changes on a regular basis and needs to be "up to the minute" accurate.

This project demos some examples on re-using the GraphQL knowledge gained with working in Gatsby to make client-side calls to update the static content with fresh data from the server.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local computer

2. Install the local dependencies `yarn` or `npm install`

3. Run the development server with `yarn develop`.

## Use your own Content

You can create your own content repo by [signing up for a free, developer account](https://app.graphcms.com/signup) at GrapCMS, create a new project from **Template** and then choose the Travel Site project.

You will need to modify the schema to add a slug field to generate the individual hotel pages.
